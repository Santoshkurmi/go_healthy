```bash
git init #for initilization of git
git config --global user.email "your email"  #to set your email in git
git config --global user.name "your sweet name" #No need explanation here

git add .  #for adding all the files in git and sending it into git staging area
git commit -m "any commit message here"   # for confirming the changes 

# To see changes and modifcation status,use 
git status

#to add your github repo in git,
git remote add origin urlOfYourGithub #to add your github repo in "origin" branch ..you can give any name here inplace of origin..

#for example,for our case of go healthy website,it is best to do
git add remote gohealty https://github.com/Santoshkurmi/go_healthy  #I have added my repo in "gohealty" branch in git

#After adding the repo in git,we can now push it
#Before pushing make sure you have commited it by 
@
git add . 
git commit -m "any commit message here" 
@

#After commiting,
git push branchNameOfGithub branchNameOfLocalGit  #branchNameoFgithub is the branch name given by adding remote repo.
#branchNameOfLocalGit is "master"

#for my case above,I have given name of My github repo branch as "gohealthy" so for me,
git push gohealthy master

#Thats all


```
